# Server-SideAPIs_Weather-Dashboard

## Description

- This is my first Server-Side API homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
- The homework assignment was to use a third-party API, OpenWeatherMap to build a weather dashboard that would run in a browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- Features incorporated to the final product are: A search bar for retreiving weather information for any U.S. city, a display of current day weather conditions, a display for five day weather forcast, and the ability to save searched cities to the page for future use.
- As a starting point, I used CSS and HTML files from one of week 6 in class activities. From there I built my JS from scratch and modified the CSS and HTML files as needed to suit the purpose of the homework assignment.
- In completing this assignment I was able to apply the lessons from week six and the following skills: Call and retrieve information from a third-party API, use API documentation to ensure proper usage of API retrieved data, use JS to manipulate the DOM in order to make my HTML dynamic, and save and retrieve data to and from the local storage. 

The following are screenshots of the final version of the webpage when it was first submitted for review. The first screenshot is of the page when it first opens. The Second screenshot shows it in use and the last screenshoot shows how the page would display in a smaller screen size device.
